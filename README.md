# modeling_met_ensemble
Generation of spatially- and temporally downscaled met driver ensemble for uncertainty analysis and data assimilation

These scripts are used to generate new met drivers for PalEON MIP Phase 3.  Phase 3 is focused on data assimilation and uncertainty.  Met drivers generated by these scripts with be filtered through empirical paleo-ecological records.

The met ensemble will be generated at the site level (not regional).  Current PalEON modeling sites are as follows:
* Site (code): longitude, latitude
- Harvard Forest (PHA): -72.18, 42.54
- Howland Forest (PHO): -68.73, 45.25
- UNDERC (PUN): -89.53, 46.22
- Billy's Lake (PBL): -94.58, 46.28
- Deming Lake (PDL): -95.17, 47.17
- Minden Bog (PMB): -82.83, 43.61

Key Project Personel as of 25 March 2015:
